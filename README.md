# Virtual box pentesting environment


Your revised text is clear and well-structured. However, there is a small spelling error in the last paragraph. The correct spelling is "Environment" instead of "Enviroment." Here's the corrected version:

This lab is a VirtualBox penetration testing environment. The goal of this lab is to set up numerous vulnerable targets against which basic penetration testing can be executed.

Furthermore, this lab will support the learning of threat detection using SIEM/XDR and adversary simulation, providing a holistic approach toward cybersecurity.

The setup guides and the exercises (yet to come) are not provided in chronological order, nor will they be at a later time. The general idea is to modularize so that one can build an exercise compendium around the guides and exercises provided in this repository. With that said, a good place to start is the [Environment setup](./EnvironmentSetup.md).
